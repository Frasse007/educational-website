                            <h2>The Birth of Basketball</h2>
                            <p>Basketball was invented in December 1891 by Dr. James Naismith. He was a Canadian physical education instructor in Springfield, Massachusetts. Naismith was tasked with creating an indoor game to keep his students active during the cold winter months. Using a soccer ball and two peach baskets nailed to elevated tracks, he developed a game that would later evolve into basketball as we know it today.</p>
                            <p>The original game had 13 basic rules and was played with nine players on each team. The objective was simple, throw the ball into the opposing team's peach basket. Unlike today's fast-paced game, players had to climb a ladder to retrieve the ball after each successful shot. It wasn't until 1906 that open-bottom nets were introduced. This significantly revolutionized the flow of the game.</p>

                <p>Basketball is played on a rectangular court with two teams of five players each. The objective is to score points by shooting the ball through the opponent's hoop, which is positioned 10 feet above the ground. A standard game consists of four quarters, each lasting 12 minutes in the NBA or 10 minutes in international and college basketball.</p>

    <p class="lead text-center text-body-secondary">Points are scored in three ways: a field goal inside the three-point line is worth two points, a shot from beyond the three-point arc is worth three points, and free throws (awarded after certain fouls) are worth one point each. The team with the most points at the end of regulation time wins the game.</p>
